# C++

An array of various projects integrated both general purpose and for computer vision.

## [Computer vision](Computer%20Vision)

Manually integrating computer vision algorithms. It is worth noting that all most of the algorithms are implemented from scratch rather than using third-party functions. In fact, the code only uses teh `Mat` data type for holding images and `imshow()` and `WaitKey()` for image display.

## [General purpose projects](General%20purpose)

Various problems solved with C++ leveraging the different data structures, and dynamic memory allocation the language has to offer.

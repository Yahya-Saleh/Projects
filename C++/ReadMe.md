# C++

An array of various projects integrated both general purpose and for computer vision.

## Computer vision

Manually integrating also of teh applications and algorithms of computer vision. It is worth noting that all most of teh algorithms are implemented from scratch rather than using third-party functions. In fact, the code only uses teh `Mat` data type for holding images and `imshow()` and `WaitKey()` for image display.

## General purpose projects

Various problems solved with C++ leveraging the different data structures, and dynamic memory allocation the language has to offer.

# Computer Vision

C++ is a powerful tool for machine learning and computer vision. The projects here leverage the power of the programming language to interact and extract information from images.

## Listed by complexity

1. [**Morphological operations for LPR plate detection**](Morphological%20operations/Morphological%20operations): Pre-processing an image for LPR plate detection using morphological operations.
2. [**RBG to grey scale to Binary**](RGB%20to%20Grey%20scale%20to%20Binary): defines two functions one to convert any RGB image to grey scale, and another to convert a grey scale to a binary image.
3. [**Image show**](show_image): displays an image.

## Side note

all of the illustrated projects where created with visual studio.

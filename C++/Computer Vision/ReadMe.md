# Computer Vision

C++ is a powerful tool for machine learning and computer vision. The projects here leverage the power of the programming language to interact and extract information from images.

## Listed by complexity

1. [**Morphological operations for LPR plate detection**](Morphological%20operations/Morphological%20operations): Pre-processing an image for LPR plate detection using morphological operations.
2. [**Edge detection**](Edge%20Detection/Edge%20Detection): Image detection is a very import task of CV and this projects leverages both Laplacian and Sobel's algorithms to detect vertical, horizontal, or both edges.
3. [**Image Histogram Equalization**](Equalize%20Histogram/Equalize%20Histogram): Histogram equalization is a method to process images in order to adjust the contrast of an image by modifying the intensity distribution of the histogram. The objective of this technique is to give a linear trend to the cumulative probability function associated to the image.
4. [**Image Convolution**](Image%20Convolution/Image%20Convolution): A very powerful tool for image preprocessing.
5. [**Math functions**](Math%20functions/Math%20functions): Math functions are algorithms that act on individual pixels in images during preprocessing. Some math functions can be useful for image pre-processing. For example, the inversion function allow a model to work on two images with inverted colors.
6. [**RBG to grey scale to Binary**](RGB%20to%20Grey%20scale%20to%20Binary): defines two functions one to convert any RGB image to grey scale, and another to convert a grey scale to a binary image.
7. [**Image show**](show_image): displays an image.

## Side note

all of the illustrated projects where created with visual studio.

/*
A studentâ€™s mark for a module is calculated based on 20% quiz, 30% assignment and 50%
final exam.

Write a C++ program for a teacher to enter and calculate the marks of his/her students in a
class. The program should ask the teacher the number of students in the class and
appropriately create array of that size to store the mark.
Then, determine the average mark for students in the class.

Input validation: Marks for each component should not be more than the maximum allocated
mark.

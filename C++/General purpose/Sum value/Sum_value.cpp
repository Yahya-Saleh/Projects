/*
Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer value. The
program should use a loop to get the sum of all the integers from 1 up
to the number entered. For example, if the user enters 50, the loop
will find the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, â€¦ 50.

Input validation: Do not accept a negative number.

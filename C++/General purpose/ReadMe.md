# General purpose projects

Various problems solved with C++ leveraging the different data structures, and dynamic memory allocation the language has to offer.

you can also view the [Computer Vision projects](../Computer%20Vision).

## Listed by complexity

1. [**Class info Linked List**](ClassInfo%20Linked%20List): Defining a `class_room` class to hold and manage student nodes using a Linked List data structure.
2. [**Students' average grade**](students_avg_grade): a program that prompts the user for the number of their students and creates an array of that size, takes in each student's grades and displays the average grade of all teh students.
3. [**Balanced brackets**](Balanced%20brackets): One application of the `Stack` data structure is to evaluate if a given string, like C++ code for example, have the correct order of brackets.
4. [**Palindrome**](palindrome): takes a word as input and evaluates if it is a palindrome or not.
5. [**Convert with pointers**](convert_with_pointers): a program that converts a given double to centimeters, with 4 decimal precision, using pointers and memory addresses.
6. [**Bubble sort**](bubble_sort): sorting 10 given numbers using bubble sort.
7. [**MiniMax**](MiniMax): prompts the user for 10 integers and prints the biggest and smallest numbers.
8. [**Population**](Population): a class representation of a population.
9. [**Roman Numerals**](Roman%20Numerals): a program that asks the user to enter a number within the range of 1 through 10 and returns the Roman numeral version of that number with a clever use of teh `switch` statement.
10. [**Bank account**](Bank%20account): A class representing a bank account.
11. [**Sum value 2**](Sum%20value%202): an improvement on [`sum value`](Sum%20value) where the program takes in two positive integers and prints out the sum from the former to the later inclusively.
12. [**Sum value**](Sum%20value): a program that takes in a positive number and prints out the sum from 1 all the way to that number.
13. [**Grader**](grade): a program that grades the answers based on a given model answer and indicates weather the test taker passed or failed.
14. [**Array in memory**](array_memory): a simple project that illustrates how array elements are stored in memory.
15. [**Even counter**](Even_counter): a function that takes in an array of `int`s and its size and returns the number of even numbers inside the array.
16. [**Summation**](summation): prompts the user for 10 numbers and prints their summation.
17. [**greatest Rectangle area**](rect_area): a program that prompts teh user for the measurements of two rectangles and returns which one has a greater area.
18. [**Convert**](convert): a program that converts meters to feet and inches.
19. [**Hello name**](hello_name): hello you?
20. [**Hello**](hello): here we go again ;)

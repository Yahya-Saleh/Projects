# Population

A class representation of a population.

## Execution

```bash
Population size: 500000
Births: 5000
Birth rate: %1
Deaths: 1000
Death rate: %0.2
```

## Background

In a population, the birth rate and death rate are calculated as follows:

- Birth rate = Number of births / population
- Death rate = Number of deaths / population

For example, in a population of 100,000 that has 8,000 births and 6,000
deaths per year, the birth rate and death rate are:

- Birth rate = 8,000 / 100,000 = 0.08
- Death rate = 6,000 / 100,000 = 0.06

Input validation: Do not accept population figures less than 1 or birth/ death
numbers less than 0.

# Array in memory

A simple project that illustrates how array elements are stored in memory.

## Execution

```bash
Address of the nums variable: 0x7bfe00
The same as the address of the first element nums[0]: 0x7bfe00
The address of the second element nums[1] is right after: 0x7bfe04
And so forth: 0x7bfe08
```

            <h2>What is adware?</h2>
            <br/>
            <p>Adware is unwanted software designed to throw advertisements up on your screen, most often within a web browser.
            Some security professionals view it as the forerunner of the modern-day PUP (potentially unwanted program).
            Typically, it uses an underhanded method to either disguise itself as legitimate,
            or piggyback on another program to trick you into installing it on your PC, tablet, or mobile device.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>How do I get adware?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>There are two main ways by which adware sneaks onto your system.
            In the first one, you download a program—usually freeware or shareware—and it quietly installs adware without your knowledge, or permission.
            That’s because the program’s author signed up with the adware vendor. Why?
            Because the revenue generated by the advertisements enables the program to be offered gratis
            (although even paid software from an untrustworthy source can deliver an adware payload).
            Then the adware launches its mischief, and the user learns there’s a price to pay for “free.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Types of Adware</h2>
            <br>
            <p>For all the ways adware tries to dig into your PC or other device, most adware strategies qualify as browser hijackers.
            These interlopers specialize in modifying Internet browser settings without the user’s knowledge or consent.
            Typically, hijackers change the homepage and default search settings.
            You’re happily surfing along when suddenly the ads start pummeling you.
            You might naturally assume that the ads originate from the site you’re visiting, but they aren’t.
            But since they appear in the form of pop-ups or pop-unders, they seem that they are embedded in the site itself.</p>

            <p>Once again, there are adware programs that change your start page, your search engine,
            or even fiddle with the shortcuts on your computer that open your browsers.
            There is also, of course, different adware for different devices and operating systems.
            So you might have to cope with mobile/Android adware, Mac adware, or Windows adware.</p>

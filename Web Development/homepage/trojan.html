            <h2>What is a Trojan Horse</h2>
            <br>
            <p>In computing, a Trojan horse, or Trojan, is any malware which misleads users of its true intent.
            The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy.</p>

            <p> Unexpected changes to computer settings and unusual activity, even when the computer should be idle, are strong indications that a Trojan is residing on a computer.</p>


            <p>Typically, the Trojan horse is hidden in an innocent-looking email attachment or free download.
            When the user clicks on the email attachment or downloads the free program,
            the malware that is hidden inside is transferred to the user's computing device.
            Once inside, the malicious code can execute whatever task the attacker designed it to carry out.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>How does a Trojan work</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Before a Trojan horse can infect a machine, the user must download the server side of the malicious application.
            The Trojan horse cannot manifest by itself; the executable file (exe file)
            must be implemented and the program must be installed in order for the attack to be unleashed on the system.
            Social engineering tactics are often used to convince end users to download the malicious application.
            The download trap may be found in banner ads, website links or pop-up advertisements.</p>

            <p>However, the most popular tactic for spreading Trojan horses is through seemingly unthreatening emails and email attachments.
            Trojan horse developers frequently use spamming techniques to send their emails to hundreds or thousands of people.
            As soon as the email has been opened and the attachment has been downloaded,
            the Trojan server will be installed and will run automatically each time the computer turns on.</p>

            <h2>Uses of a Trojan</h2>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>give the attacker backdoor control over the computing device</li>
                <li>record keyboard strokes to steal the user's account data and browsing history</li>
                <li>download and install a virus or worm to exploit a vulnerability in another program</li>
                <li>install ransomware to encrypt the user's data and extort money for the decryption key</li>
                <li>activate the computing device's camera and recording capabilities</li>
                <li>turn the computer into a zombie computer that can be used to carry out click fraud schemes or illegal actions</li>
                <li>legally capture information relevant to a criminal investigation for law enforcement.</li>

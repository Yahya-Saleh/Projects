            <h2>What is Spyware</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Spyware is unwanted software that infiltrates your computing device, stealing your internet usage data and sensitive information.
            Spyware is classified as a type of malware — malicious software designed to gain access to or damage your computer, often without your knowledge.
            Spyware gathers your personal information and relays it to advertisers, data firms, or external users.</p>

            <h2>How do I get spyware?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Spyware can affect PCs, Macs, and iOS or Android devices.
            Although Windows operating systems may be more susceptible to attacks, attackers are becoming better at infiltrating Apple’s operating systems as well.
            Some of the most common ways your computer can become infected with spyware include these:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Accepting a prompt or pop-up without reading it first</li>
                <li>Downloading software from an unreliable source</li>
                <li>Opening email attachments from unknown senders</li>
                <li>Pirating media such as movies, music, or games</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>How to recognize spyware on your device</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Spyware can be difficult to recognize on your device.
            By its nature, it’s meant to be deceptive and hard to find.
            But there are clues that can help you identify whether you’ve been infected by spyware.
            You may have a spyware issue if your computer shows these symptoms.</p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Your device is slow or crashes unexpectedly.</li>
                <li>Your device is running out of hard drive space.</li>
                <li>You get pop-ups when you are online or offline.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>How to remove spyware</h2>
            <p>If you think your device is infected with spyware, run a scan with your current security software to make sure it has cleaned up everything it can.
            Next, download and run a virus removal tool, such as the free Norton Power Eraser.</p>

            <p>There are also other reputable anti-spyware removal tools. Some of them work only when you manually start the scan.
            Others continuously monitor your computer to make sure spyware can’t modify or monitor your information.</p>

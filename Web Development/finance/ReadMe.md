# Finance
A web app via which the user can manage portfolios of stocks. Not only will this tool allow them to check real stocks’ actual prices and portfolios’ values, it will also let them buy (okay, “buy”) and sell (okay, “sell”) stocks by querying IEX for stocks’ prices. the user can also view the stocks he bought along with its current price and bought price, and he can view the history of his purchases.

Indeed, IEX lets us download stock quotes via their API (application programming interface) using URLs like https://cloud-sse.iexapis.com/stable/stock/nflx/quote?token=API_KEY.

The website is very neatly designed and implemented, with embedded error and database handling.s

# Copy
This program along with the bmp.h library was given by CS50 to its students for them to self understand and digest. Students are required to answer some questions about the library and the BMP file format in general- hence Question.md. 

Furthermore, students are required to build programs based on copy.c after understanding the code themselves.

## Usage
the program takes in two arguments when executes: the bmp file to copy followed by the name of the file storing the copy that will be created. the out-file doesn't need to exist before hand.

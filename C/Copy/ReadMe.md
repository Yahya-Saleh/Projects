# Copy

AS CS50 students, we were given [`copy.c`](copy.c) and the library `bmp.h` to dissect and understand bitmaps and how to handle them in C.d

Using the knowledge that we acquire, we then solved a number of questions, documented in [`Bitmap Questions.md`](C/../../Bitmap%20Questions.md), and build a program based on [`copy.c`](copy.c).

## Usage

```bash
./copy img/small.bmp copy.bmp
```

The program takes in two arguments when executes: the bmp file to copy followed by the name of the file that will store the copy to be created. the out-file doesn't need to exist before hand.

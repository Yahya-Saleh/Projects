## Usage
Using the greedy algorithm, this program will take the change owed as input and outputs the least number of coins to be returned.

## Greedy Algorithm
According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a greedy algorithm is one “that always takes the best immediate, or local, solution while finding an answer. Greedy algorithms find the overall, or globally, optimal solution for some optimization problems, but may find less-than-optimal solutions for some instances of other problems.”

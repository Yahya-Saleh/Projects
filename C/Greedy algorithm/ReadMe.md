# Cash

Using the greedy algorithm, this program will take a change as input and outputs the least number of coins to be returned.

## Usage

```bash
$ ./cash
change owed: 1.2
number of coins: 6
```

Upon running the program the user is prompted for the change owned. The program takes in the change owed and returns the number of coins.

## Greedy Algorithm

According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a greedy algorithm is one “that always takes the best immediate, or local, solution while finding an answer. Greedy algorithms find the overall, or globally, optimal solution for some optimization problems, but may find less-than-optimal solutions for some instances of other problems.”

# C programming

this file includes an array of complex C programs that implements algorithms, and solve problems with high functionality. those programs will include, among other things, concepts like the following:

- command-line arguments.
- pointers.
- data structures (single and double linked lists, hash tables, and tries).
- dynamic and static memory allocation.
  
When developing my code as you will note: speed and efficiency are maximized!

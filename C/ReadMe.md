# C
A list of complex C programs that implement algorithms, and solve problems with high functionality. those programs implement the basics of C all the way to libraries, pointers and data structures like tries. Making use of dynamic memory and static memory, along side memory handling. When developing my code as you will note- speed and efficiency are maximized.

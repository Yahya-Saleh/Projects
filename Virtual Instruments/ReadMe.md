# Virtual Instruments

An array of Virtual instruments that I developed using NI LabView. The projects shown display various concepts: from simple circuit building to client and server communication and handling.

## Projects listed by complexity

1. [**Tank Monitor**](Tank%20Monitor): A system that tracks the tank volume and raises an alarm or warning depending on the indicator. This  system was upgraded to remotely raise teh warnings through TCP/IP.

2. [**Login**](Login%20with%20table): Three different VIs that integeragtes the login functionality.

3. [**Nuclear station safety system**](Nuclear%20station%20safety%20system/): A remote safety system that monitors the temperature, pressure, and water volume of a nuclear station, raising an alarm when necessarily.

4. [**2 Traffic Lights**](2%20Traffic%20Lights): Simulates two traffic lights operating with synchronization.

5. [**Home**](Home): A simple home control system connected via TCP/IP.

6. [**Traffic Light**](Traffic%20light): Simulates a traffic light with blinking logic as well as a label.

7. [**Surface Area, Volume, and Algebra**](Surface%20Area,%20Volume,%20and%20Algebra): Takes in the radius and height of a cone and calculates both the surface area and volume. A second tab allows the user to input x and y for an arithmetic function.

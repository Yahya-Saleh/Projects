# Kotlin

Some starter projects that I have developed while learning Kotlin before starting with mobile development using Android studio.

## Side note

Since Kotlin is made for UI design getting a user's input is not easy nor necessary since I learnt it for mobile app engineering. For this reason console project in this repository do not prompt the user for input.

## Projects listed by complexity

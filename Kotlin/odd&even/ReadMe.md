# Odd & Even

A program that counts the number of odd and even integer in the `numbers` array.

## Execution

when `numbers` is

```Kotlin
val numbers = Array(10, { i -> i + 1 })
```

The result is

```bash
5 odd number(s) and 5 even number(s)
```

## Side note

Since Kotlin is made for UI design getting a user's input is not easy nor necessary since I learnt it for mobile app engineering. For this reason console project in this repository do not prompt the user for input.

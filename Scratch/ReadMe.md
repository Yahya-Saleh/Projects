A simple game developed by [MIT's Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). This project was a good starting point to get a sense of programming and its concepts in a simplified form.

## About the game

The player controls the flying cat trying to dodge the buildings. the cat can move in all directions. If the cat hits a building the ouch counter gets iterated by 1. As time progresses the game gets more difficult.

# JSON

**JavaScript Object Notion (JSON)** is a standard file format that was inspired by JavaScript, but is no longer tied to it. The JSON format is very popular for storing and transmitting data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value).

## Handling JSON files in python

Python has the JSON module as part of the standard library that allows us to read and manipulate JSON files.

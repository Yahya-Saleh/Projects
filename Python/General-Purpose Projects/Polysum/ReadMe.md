# Poly sum

A function that takes in the number of sides of a regular polygon and their length and returns sum the area and square of the perimeter

## Background

A regular polygon has `n` number of sides. Each side has length `s`.

- The area of a regular polygon is:  $\frac{0.25∗n∗{s}^{2}}{tan(π/n)}$

- The perimeter of a polygon is: length of the boundary of the polygon

## Task

Write a function called `polysum` that takes 2 arguments, n and s.

This function should sum the area and square of the perimeter of
the regular polygon. The function returns the sum, rounded to 4 decimal places.

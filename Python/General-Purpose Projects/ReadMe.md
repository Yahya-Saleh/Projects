# General-Purpose Projects

The following projects do not strictly fall under a specific field of computer science; however, they still implement solutions to really world problems.

## Listed by complexity

1. [**WhatsAppAutomation**](Whatsapp_Automation): A Graphical user interface That sends specified text message or attachment to a given number(s). [Check the illustration!](https://youtu.be/NItektT6gao)

2. [**DNA**](DNA): A program that identifies a person based on their DNA.
3. [**Hangman**](hangman): A variation of the classic word game Hangman. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the rules, you may read all about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)). The second player will always be the computer, who will be picking a word at random.
4. [**Credit card debt**](Credit%20card%20debt): A three part project implementing programs that answer questions pertaining to credit card debt.
5. [**Voice**](Voice): This program touches on the foundation of AI. Using Google's voice recognition system it listens to the users speaks and depending on what it hear the machine responds automatically, it can even memorize the user's name.
6. [**Credit**](Credit): Using some fundamental knowledge about how credit (or debit) cards like the number's length and structure along with luhan's Algorithm, one can devise a program to validate a card's number.
7. [**Is in**](is%20in): A function that behaves like the `in` in Python: returns true if a character is in a given string using recursion.
8. [**Readability**](Readability): A program that computes the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text Using the Coleman-Liau index.
9. [**longest_substring**](Longest_substring): A program that prints the longest substring in which the letters occur in alphabetical order.
10. [**GCD recur**](GCD%20recur): A function that takes in two positive integers and returns the greatest common denominator using recursion
11. [**Mario**](Mario): Much like the [mario in the C projects](../../C/Mario), This project Recreates the double pyramids in the mario game using # with a height specified by the user between 1 and 8 inclusive. However, since its done in python it requires advanced understanding of the print function.
12. [**Polysum**](Polysum): A function that takes in the number of sides of a regular polygon and their length and returns sum the area and square of the perimeter.
13. [**CursorLocator**](CursorLocator.py)
14. [**Hello**](hello.py)

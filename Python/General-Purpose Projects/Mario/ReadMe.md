# Mario

![Mario pyramid](../../../Snippets/C/mario%20pyramids.png)

Much like the [mario in the C projects](../../C/Mario/mario.c), This project Recreates the double pyramids in the mario game using # with a height specified by the user between 1 and 8 inclusive. However, since its done in python it requires advanced understanding of the print function.

## Usage

```bash
$ python mario.py
Height: 8
       #  #
      ##  ##
     ###  ###
    ####  ####
   #####  #####
  ######  ######
 #######  #######
########  ########
```
